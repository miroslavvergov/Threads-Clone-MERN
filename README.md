A Full-stack Threads clone built With React, MongoDB, ExpressJS, NodeJS, JWT, Cloudinary

Front-end Notes:
  -on the frontend the app uses ReactJS combined with Chakra UI to provide the best user experience
  -in order to use state in all of the app we are using atoms by using Recoil library
On the backend as expected we operate with nodejs and in the package we can see we are using
express.
